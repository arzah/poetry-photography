    <p>In 2018 I graduated from my small school in The Bahamas and went on to become a Computer Science student
      at the University of Central Florida. In a new country without any friends and family it was rather hard for me to adjust at first. Despite goiing
      to Florida quite frequently for shopping visiting and living were to completely different things and the culture change
      did give me a bit of a shock.

   <h3>The Adjustment</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-4">
   <p>My first year was pretty hectic. coming from the second most populated island in my country, with the population of 50 thousand, 
    UCF's boasts of 66k+ students was a large adjustment for me. Perhaps the most annoying of all was all the lines. Everyone hates lines but back home
    they were never a problem, at most the longest line would be around 10 people however here I would be lucky to find a line with only 10 people.

<h3>First Major</h3>

      <p>My major of choice was Computer Science. It was a last minute whim of a choice, originally I was going to college to be a chemical 
          engineer but during my last year of school my hatred of chemistry reached a new level. I didn't know much about Computer Science
          except for the fact that it was about programming. And, since I rather enjoyed the basic CodeAcademy lessons, I thought it would be the 
          major for me.

      <h3>Second Major</h3>
  
      <p>At the end of my first year, after the harsh adjustment to clases that contained more people then my entire school, I was feeling dejected.
          I've always been good at everything I tried but college was proving to be a challenge I hadn't expected. My major was also not as visual as
          I thought it would be. I was at the point that most college students find themselves of wanting to change majors but not knowing what to pick. 
          However through my searching Digital Media was one that stuck out to me. And on a late Summer afternoon I made the switch

      <h3>Hurricane Dorian</h3>
      <p>My second year had only just started when I was struck with bad news. A category 5 Hurricane was heading straight for the island I was from. This would be 
          the first hurricane to hit the island without me being there and I was anxious for my family. I know that they've been through hurricanes without me before I was born 
          but something felt wrong with me being safe and sound in Orlando while my family was facing unkown conditions. I would have much rathered to be there with them. Matters were
          only made worst when the Hurricane stoped while having wind gusts over 200mph. Being on social media also didn't help as I saw the streets I was just walking in flooded and friends 
          and family showing videos of them trapped in their houses with the water rapidly rising. Knowing that the power was out and the phone service was spotty I could only wait anxiously for 
          my mom to reassure me that she was alright. And luckily our house was in one of the few area's that didn't flood.

      <h3>Digital Media</h3>
        <p>Despite the stress of Dorian my second year saw me in my new major and this time I was more prepared. My roommates and I had become close during our first year and 
            chose to room again together. I also had classes that I found interesting and my grades reflected that fact. As I made the Dean list every semester after my major change. This new major was shaping up to be 
            a 'jack of all trades' and perfectly aligned with my interest of dabbling in things such as film/editing, photoshop, art and most importantly, coding.

      <p>My second year ended with the start of the Corona Virus pandemic. My dad had decided to visit me for Spring Break, and, after the decision of the school to go online, he placed all of my things in storage
          and we flew back home. Finishing the semester at home would usually had been fine with me as I could see my friends earlier. Unfortunately we all ended up being stuck in either different countries or different a 
          different island as lockdowns grew heavier. So I could only really entertain myself with my classes. They were all rather easy to adjust to online except for art. There is not a wide variety of art supplies on my 
          island so I had to plan ahead and buy anything that I thought I would need for art while I was still in Orlando, as it's better to be safe then sorry.

<div class="grid-13">
      <p>If the stress of Covid didn't make the start of my 3rd year uncertain then it was the stress of figuring out if ICE would force me back to complete in person classes. I've never felt more stressed
        then I was this summer, anxiously waiting for ICE to make a final decision on foreign students, and trying to think of backup plan for classes and travel in case I forced to go back. It was a great relief
        when they decided that we could take our classes online from our home country without being penalised. But other then that my third year has been going just fine. I've been doing some coding projects on the side
        based off of classes I've had this semester as I find them all to be really interesting.
